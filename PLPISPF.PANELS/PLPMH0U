+  Welcome to the ISPF Dialog that provides the management interface to the
+  application products available under ISPF.
+
+ `Command options:+
+
+ `F xxx+     Find the specified character string in any position of the
+             application name or description.  The cursor is positioned
+             on that row for easy starting by just pressing the Enter key.
+
+ `I+         Insert a new application.
+
+ `L xx+      Locate the specified character prefix in the first positions
+             of the application name.  The cursor is positioned on the
+             first match on that row for easy starting by just pressing
+             the Enter key.
+
+ `S app opt+ Starts the application specified and passed the specified
+             options to the command.
+             e.g. S SDSF ST
+
+ `Save+      Save the Application table.
+
+ `Cancel+    Cancel updates to the Application table.

+ `Line options:+
+
+ `A+         Create and Alias for a command.  The alias will always execute
+             the original command.
+
+ `B+         Browse brief information on the current application.
+             (not available for all applications)
+
+ `C+         Change the current application
+
+ `E+         Edit the brief information on the current application.
+
+ `I+         Insert a new application
+
+ `L+         Launch the current application.  This is different from Select
+             because the application is started in a new ISPF Session.  To
+             switch from it you should change your SWAP ISPF Key from SWAP
+             to SWAP LIST.
+
+ `R+         Repeat the current application with a different name.
+             Allows cloning of one application to another (perhaps
+             a new release).
+
+ `S+         Select the current application to start.
