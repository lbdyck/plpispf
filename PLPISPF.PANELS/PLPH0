)Area Help
+  Welcome to the ISPF Product Launch Point application selection tool.
+
+  This ISPF Dialog provides a simple interface to access many of the
+  products available under ISPF.  Usage is as simple as find the
+  application and select it to start it.
+
+ `Command options:+
+
+ `F xxx+     Find the specified character string in any position of the
+             application name or description.  The cursor is positioned
+             on that row for easy starting by just pressing the Enter key.
+
+ `L xx+      Locate the specified character prefix in the first positions
+             of the application name.  The cursor is positioned on the
+             first match on that row for easy starting by just pressing
+             the Enter key.
+
+ `O xxx+     Only display those applications that match the string.
+
+ `Reset +     Redisplays ALL applications after the use of Only
+
+ `S app opt+ Starts the application specified and passed the specified
+             options to the command.
+             e.g. S SDSF ST
+
+  or`any+application name in the menu with or without options.
+             e.g. SDSF ST
+
+ `Line options:+
+
+ `B+         Browse brief information on the current application.
+             (not available for all applications)
+
+ `I+         Display the PLP information for this command.
+
+ `L+         Launch the current application.  This is different from Select
+             because the application is started in a new ISPF Session.  To
+             switch from it you should change your SWAP ISPF Key from SWAP
+             to SWAP LIST. More information follows on this.
+
+ `S+         Select the current application to start.
+
+ `U+         Select the current application and ADD it to the USER
+             applications list.  During the addition there is an
+             option to change the application name and other options.
+
+             Note: The USER applications list is maintained in the
+                   users ISPF Profile dataset.
+
+ `Launch considerations+
+
+  ISPF supports up to 8 different Split Sessions.  To switch between 2
+  sessions is easy using the default PF9/PF21 key which is defined as SWAP.
+  To switch between more than 2 sessions requires the use of either the
+  SWAP LIST or the SWAP NEXT command.
+
+  To change your default SWAP key from SWAP to SWAP LIST or SWAP NEXT:
+
+  1. On the ISPF Command line enter KEYS
+  2. Change the command for PF9 to SWAP LIST or SWAP NEXT
+  3. Scroll down to PF21 and change it as well
+
+  Note: You may have to do this several times as each ISPF application
+  may have a different ISPF Profile which will have to be updated.
