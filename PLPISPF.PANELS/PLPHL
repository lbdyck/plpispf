+  You have selected to use the Launch option to start the selected
+  application in a new ISPF Session.  This tutorial will provide you with
+  some information that you may require to be able to successfully switch
+  between the multiple ISPF Sessions.
+
+  You will only see this tutorial once - this information is also in the
+  main tutorial.+
+
+  ISPF supports up to 32 different Split Sessions.  To switch between 2
+  sessions is easy using the default PF9/PF21 key which is defined as SWAP.
+  To switch between more than 2 sessions requires the use of either the
+  SWAP LIST or the SWAP NEXT command.
+
+  To change your default SWAP key from SWAP to SWAP LIST or SWAP NEXT:
+
+  1. On the ISPF Command line enter KEYS
+  2. Change the command for PF9 to SWAP LIST or SWAP NEXT
+  3. Scroll down to PF21 and change it as well
+
+  Note: You may have to do this several times as each ISPF application
+  may have a different ISPF Profile which will have to be updated.
