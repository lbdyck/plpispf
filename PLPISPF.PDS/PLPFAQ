This is release 1.1 of the Product Launch Point (PLP) Frequently Asked
Questions.  Send questions and/or comments to Lionel B Dyck (via Notes) or
lionel.b.dyck@kp.org (via other mailers).

1. What is PLP?

PLP is short for Product Launch Point.  It is an enhanced, flexible,
dynamic ISPF menuing environment that has been implemented at Kaiser.

2. I notice from the documentation that I can use PLP from any ISPF
   panel.  Why is this?

PLP has been implemented as an ISPF command using the ISPF system
command table.  This enables the PLP command to be accessed from any
ISPF menu or panel. This makes it easier to access the ISPF applications
that you want to use without requiring that you return to the ISPF
Primary Options Menu.

Along with PLP the following commands have also been implemented as ISPF
Commands:

>  PLPG
   Product Launch Point Group application.  This enables access to a
   group menu of applications (see below for the question on what PLPG
   is).

>  PLPU
   Product Launch Point User application.  This command enables access
   to the user menu of applications.  This is the same as option Z on
   the ISPF Primary Options menu.


To add a fast path let's use an example.  In this example you have a need to
access data that resides in the SARPROD3 database and formerly you entered
K.U.S.1.3.  With the PLP implementation you now need to enter PLP CAVIEW 1.3.

To simplify this from the PLP list of application place a U in the selection
field next to CAVIEW.   The following screen is displayed:

-----------------------  Product Launch Point Management --------------------
Command ===>

 Enter, Verify, or Change (* = required)

*Application Name          CAVIEW__ A unique application name 1-8 characters
*Description               CA-View (formerly SAR) Menu______________________

*Application Start
    Command     %PLPISPF CAVIEW
    Options:    _______________________________________________ Changeable

Change the Application Name from CAVIEW to CAV (for example) and enter into
the Options field 1.3, and if you wish you can change the Description to
something more meaningful.

-----------------------  Product Launch Point Management --------------------
Command ===>

 Enter, Verify, or Change (* = required)

*Application Name          CAV   __ A unique application name 1-8 characters
*Description               SARPROD3______________________

*Application Start
    Command     %PLPISPF CAVIEW
    Options:    1.3____________________________________________ Changeable

Then press PF3 to save this into your private User application list.
Note that the Command field is not changeable.

From this point on you only need to enter command PLPU CAV.

You can do this with all of the applications that you use frequently if you
wish.

4. Do I have to start PLP before I can select an application?

The answer to this is no.  If you know the application name you can
enter PLP followed by the application name to directly access that
application.  If the app is not found then the PLP will display with the
cursor next to the application that most closely matches the name.

You can also enter PLP app options if you know there are options that you
wish to pass to the application.

For example you could enter PLP CAVIEW 1.3 to open CA-View with option 1.3.

5. I know that an application allows options but I don't know how to enter
   them from the PLP list?

With PLP you can not enter an option if you use the S (for start) or L
(for launch) row selection.  However you can specify options if you
enter S app options on the PLP command line.

6. You mentioned L for Launch.  What is that option?

Launching an application will start another ISPF screen.  ISPF, in the Kaiser
implementation, supports up to 8 split screens.  Thus using Launch you can
open a new screen within ISPF for the application.  Note that if you do this
that you will have to (1) remember the screen name or (2) change your swap
key from SWAP to SWAP LIST or SWAP NEXT.

SWAP LIST will bring up a list of open screens that you can then select and
switch to as shown below:

             ISPF Task List
     Active ISPF Logical Sessions

      ID  Name      Panelid   Applid
   .  1             ISR@PRIM  ISR
   .  2*  SDSF      ISFPCU41  ISF
   .  3-  PLP       PLPLIST   PLP

Notice that some of the sessions have a Name (or Screen Name) associated with
them.  This allows you to enter SWAP name to switch directly to that
session.  In the same way you can enter SWAP # to switch to that session ID.

SWAP NEXT will switch to the next screen in the list.

The first time that you use the Launch option you will be presented with an
ISPF tutorial about this and how to change your SWAP program function keys.

7. I know the application name, why do I have to select it, why can't I
   just enter the application name on the command line of the PLP menu?

You can but the application name must be an exact match. For example, you
can enter CAVIEW but you can not enter CAV. If you enter an application name
that is not found by an exact match then the table is positioned to the
nearest close match.
